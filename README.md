# Audio Visualizer
## Rich Media Web App
### 2015

The audio visualizer is a fun interactive application where audio nodes are translated into geometric forms by drawing them on a canvas. The audio visualizer is interactive as it also allows users to sketch things on the canvas and save them. The brush tool is directly influenced by the audio nodes. The user can also change the amplitude of the audio nodes, they can switch between audio being processed as a frequency or a wave length, they can delay the audio and change the color of the drawings. The audio visualizer comes with four songsToca Madera by Los Wálters, Soñar es mi juego by Tototomás, 'Cause I'm a man by Tame Impala, and Lux Aeterna by Clint Mastell.
